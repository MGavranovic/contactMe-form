# emailing form test project

This project is for testing purposes.

I'm testing and trying out a way to implement Contact Me Form in my final version of the
[Portfolio](https://github.com/MGavranovic/Portfolio).

I used [smtp.js](https://smtpjs.com/) to send emails and [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) for better looking and more sylish alerts.
